# Complexity Analysis

## What is it?

Complexity analysis is a way to represent the time and space taken by an algorithm based on it's input size.

There are two complexities which are extremely important: **Time Complexity** and **Space Complexity**.

Space complexity: The amount of memory needed to run an algorithm.

Time complexity: How long it takes for an algorithm to run.

Time and space complexity are notated as O(n). This is called **Big O Notation**.
Big O notation is the most common way to express an algorithm's time and space complexity. n is the input, and O
indicates that the time required t
