# Hashing

## What is a hash table?

Hash tables are on of my favorite data structures and also one of the msot useful. Whenever I try to solve a problem, I always try to use a hash map because of how convenient and efficient they are.

A hash table is a data structure that uses and associative method to store data in the form of **key-value** pairs. Keys are unique and ar mapped to values. 

Key-value pairing makes the data organization and access extremely efficient (hence why I like it so much). Since in order to access the data you just need a key, the time complexity is O(1). Compare this to a list: to access a single random value in the list, the average time complexity is O(n).

Basically, hash table are **very efficient and fast**.
